The project's core objective is organ segmentation, involving the precise delineation of lungs,
brain, heart from CT scans. This specialized focus ensures the accurate extraction and isolation
of organ structures, contributing to the advancement of medical imaging technology. The
developed tool, designed for both medical professionals and students, excels in this targeted
task, facilitating improved disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and supporting medical
research initiatives. The aim is to provide a user-friendly solution that seamlessly integrates into
healthcare workflows, enhancing the overall efficacy of organ segmentation in 3D medical
images.
Project also contains Unreal Engine file for Virtual Reality which is not added into repository.
